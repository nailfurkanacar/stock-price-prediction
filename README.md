# Stock Price Prediction

This is my senior project at Ozyegin University. The main aim of this project is the prediction of the next 30 day's close prices of NASDAQ.

In the first phase of this project, a univariate estimation algorithm was developed. This algorithm was developed with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a deep learning algorithm. 

In the second phase of this project, a multivariate estimation algorithm is developed, and a more stable and accurate estimation is tried. The factors affecting the price of the stock was investigated and "Fed Funds, Gross Domestic Price, Customer Price Index and Inflation Ratio of US and Gold Spot US Dollar and Close Price and Volume of stocks" were obtained. In the second phase of the project, all or some of these factors will be added to the project, data will be enlarged, and estimation will be made. In the output: 30 days' future predictions of close prices of NASDAQ will be shown in graphs.
